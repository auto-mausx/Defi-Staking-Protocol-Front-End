# DeFi Staking Protocol Front End

This is the front end for my [Defi Staking Protocol](https://github.com/auto-mausx/Defi-Staking-Protocol) contracts. This is mainly from the Chainlink Hackathon 2022, however I will be attempting to host this entire application with [Fleek](https://fleek.co) to see what that platform is capable of.

I plan on adding on to this code base and experiment with Defi as I go along.

## Getting Started

### Backend

I recommend checking out my backend code/smart contracts and deploy those locally first, so all of the front end code works correctly. You may need to change the ABI's and addresses according to your local deployment. Check out that README for information on how to run that code and how it works.

### Frontend

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
